### Abstract

A Journey through Space is a Space-shooter game written in C++ that allows the Player to command and fight alongside their own unique squad of allies.

This gives the Player more variable approaches on how to turn the tide in battle! Is a more defense strategy necessary or can a trap be set up, in which the enemies step?

Furthermore, the game is programmed for Windows by utilizing OpenGL and other supporting libraries.
